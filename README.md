These notes and Projects were written during my learning process

## Aim

* To Document my Learning process during this free 30 day Course
* To cover as much as I can during these free period
* To put this scribbles out there for someone else to see and Learn
* It is worthy to note that some of the Notes contained in the Lessons were copied verbatim, Credits goes to the amazingg Udacity Team for the well curated, clear and concise Lessons.
* More would come in Future I guess
